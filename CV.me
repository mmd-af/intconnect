CV-ready summary and bullets for the Intconnect project

One-liner (use in Projects section):
"Built a production-ready Laravel application with Livewire and Filament, automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, and a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline deploying containerized releases to Hetzner with Cloudflare DNS."

Suggested resume bullets (select 3–5):
- Implemented infrastructure-as-code using Terraform to provision Hetzner servers, firewall rules, and Cloudflare DNS records; integrated Terraform Cloud for remote state management.
- Designed and maintained GitHub Actions pipelines that perform `terraform plan`/`apply`, orchestrate remote Docker Compose deployments, and run automated database backups with retention logic.
- Containerized the application with multi-stage Docker builds, including a frontend build stage (Vite) and optimized PHP FPM images for production.
- Built backend features in Laravel 12 (Eloquent models, migrations, server-side validation, and Livewire components for interactive UIs); integrated Filament for admin CRUD interfaces.
- Applied operational best practices: managed secrets via GitHub Secrets, enforced non-root runtime users in images, and automated migrations and storage linking during deploys.

Example achievement statements (optional, pick or adapt):
- "Automated deployment pipeline reduced manual deploy time and risk by integrating Terraform provisioning and GitHub Actions-based remote Docker deployments."
- "Established automated daily backups and 30-day retention, improving production data resilience."

Tailored bullets by role:
- Backend Engineer: "Implemented robust server-side validation, soft deletes, and media handling using Spatie Media Library; added SEO optimizations for public event pages via SEOTools."
- DevOps / SRE: "Provisioned Hetzner infrastructure with Terraform and automated end-to-end CI/CD with GitHub Actions, including post-deploy health checks and DB backups."

How to use this file:
- Copy the one-liner to your Projects section and pick 3–5 bullets most relevant to the job you apply for.
- Convert example achievements to measurable statements if you can add metrics (deploy frequency, recovery time, number of automated tasks, etc.).
